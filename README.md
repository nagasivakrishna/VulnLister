# VulnLister

This tool uses webscraping and can result in temparory block on the website https://www.rapid7.com if used extensively.
Everybody loves rapid 7 but the fact that you gotta go open a browser and search is just boring isn't it?

I'm like "I need a tool for terminal"

So, I made this tool. Hope it helps you. If yes, leave a star ;)
